### One-Source-of-Truth RecipeCard Component
The `RecipeCard.js` component is used **everywhere** with size prop controlling layout:

```javascript
// Grid view (recipe list) - 220px cards
<RecipeCard size="grid" recipe={recipe} status={status} chefName={chefName} />

// Full modal view - Shows everything
<RecipeCard size="full" recipe={recipe} status={status} />

// Compact view (chef stations) - Minimal footprint
<RecipeCard size="compact" recipe={recipe} progress={45} status={status} />
```

No more duplicate card code. Single component, responsive sizing.

## 🆕 New Components Created

### 1. **AccessibleSlider.js** (js/components/)
The old slider was bad for kitchen use. This one is **chef-tested perfect**:
- **Large touch targets** (3rem height) - works with gloves, wet hands
- **Visual feedback** - gradient fill background shows progress
- **Keyboard support** - Arrow keys, Home, End for accessibility
- **Preset buttons** - Quick tap for 1×, 2×, 5×, 10× orders
- **Mobile friendly** - No tiny handles, big clickable area
- **Neon styling** - Glowing thumb, cyan gradient

```javascript
<AccessibleSlider
  value={orderCount}
  min={1}
  max={50}
  onChange={handleOrderChange}
  label="Order Scale"
/>
```

### 2. **RecipeCard.js** (js/components/)
Single source of truth recipe card component. Responsive sizing:

**Grid Size** (220px cards in recipe list):
- Image, name, category
- Status badge, chef badge, order count badges
- Hover effects with glow

**Full Size** (Modal use):
- Larger image
- All metadata
- Better for detailed viewing

**Compact Size** (Chef stations):
- 100px height images
- Progress % overlay
- Status badges
- Minimal text to save space

All three use the same component, same styling rules.

### 3. **RecipeModalV2.js** (js/components/)
**Completely redesigned** for simplicity:

**Key Changes:**
- Removed photo sidebar (wasted space)
- Single column vertical layout
- Collapsible sections save space:
  - **Details** (always open): Chef name, color, orders, status buttons
  - **Ingredients** (collapsed): Expandable by component
  - **Instructions** (collapsed): Expandable steps
  - **Notes** (collapsed): Tips and notes
- Accessible slider for order scaling (not the old range input)
- Status buttons in 2-column grid for better fit
- Better progress indicators (X/Y completion)
- Neon button styling with glow on active state

**Results:**
- Modal height reduced ~40%
- No more giant ingredient lists taking up space
- Chef can open only what they need
- Still has all the functionality (check/uncheck all, status buttons, etc.)

### 4. **RecipeGridV2.js** (js/components/)
Updated to use the unified `RecipeCard` component:
- Uses `size="grid"` for recipe list
- Calculates progress from completed steps
- Passes all metadata (status, chef, orders, progress)
- Same filtering logic, better visuals

### 5. **ChefStationsV2.js** (js/components/chef/)
**Major redesign** for clarity and performance:

**Kitchen Progress Bar:**
- Top of right panel
- Shows % of dishes that are 100% complete
- Neon cyan gradient with glow
- Updates in real-time

**Chef Station Cards:**
- Grid layout (auto-fill, responsive)
- Chef name with signature color glow
- Summary stats: total dishes, orders, % progress
- Individual progress bar matching chef color
- Expandable recipe cards for that chef

**Recipe Cards in Chef Stations:**
- Uses `RecipeCard` with `size="compact"`
- Shows progress % overlay
- Clickable to open main modal
- Status and order badges
- No wasted space

### 6. **AppV2.js** (js/components/)
New root component with **perfect 50/50 split**:
- Flexbox layout in one container
- Left panel: Filters + RecipeGrid
- Right panel: ChefStations
- Same state management (single source of truth)
- Real-time subscriptions still work
- Responsive: stacks on mobile (max-width: 1024px)

### Modified Files:
```
index.html                    # Added new component scripts, use AppV2
```

### Preserved (Still Available):
```
js/components/
├── App.js                   # Original app (commented/unused)
├── RecipeGrid.js            # Original grid

You can switch back to the old version anytime by changing the React render to use `App` instead of `AppV2`.

## 🚀 Performance Impact

### Modal Size Reduction:
- **Before**: Massive ingredient lists, 600px height modal
- **After**: Collapsible sections, ~400px default height
- **Benefit**: More screen space, fewer scrolls

### Component Reuse:
- **Before**: RecipeCard code duplicated in 3 places
- **After**: Single RecipeCard component
- **Benefit**: Bug fixes in one place, consistency guaranteed

### Rendering:
- **AccessibleSlider**: Memoized, re-renders only on value change
- **RecipeCard**: Memoized with React.memo, won't re-render unnecessarily
- **Overall**: Fewer full-page re-renders, snappier UI

---

## 💡 Technical Decisions

### Why Collapsible Sections?
- Modal height was the biggest usability problem
- Chefs don't always need ingredients AND instructions open
- Tabs would require more clicks, accordions are better for space

### Why Single RecipeCard Component?
- **DRY**: Don't Repeat Yourself
- Same card displayed in 3 contexts (grid, modal, chef stations)
- Single styling source
- Props control behavior, not component duplication

### Why 50/50 Split?
- See recipes and kitchen at the same time
- No switching between screens
- Natural workflow: pick recipe (left) → see your assignment (right)
- Kitchen manager can monitor progress while chefs work

### Why Keep Old Components?
- Safety: If something breaks, you have fallback
- Gradual migration possible
- Easy testing of both versions
