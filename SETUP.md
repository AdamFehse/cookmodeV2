### 3. Configure Your App

2. Replace the placeholder values:

## What's Synced in Real-Time?

- ‚úÖ **Ingredient checkboxes** - All cooks see what's been gathered
- ‚úÖ **Step completions** - Track cooking progress together
- ‚úÖ **Recipe status** - Gathered, Complete, Plated, Packed badges
- ‚úÖ **Order counts** - Recipe multiplier slider

## Troubleshooting

### No green "Real-time Sync Active" badge?
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Verify your Supabase credentials in `supabase-config.js`
- Make sure you ran the SQL schema script

### Changes not syncing?
- Check that you have internet connection
- Open browser console and look for üîî emoji logs showing updates
- Verify the SQL tables were created in Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Tables

### Console shows "Supabase not configured"?
- Update `supabase-config.js` with your real credentials

## Database Tables

The app uses 4 tables:

1. **ingredient_checks** - Tracks checked ingredients
2. **step_completions** - Tracks completed cooking steps
3. **recipe_status** - Tracks overall recipe status (gathered/complete/plated/packed)
4. **order_counts** - Tracks recipe quantity multipliers

## How It Works

1. **Optimistic UI Updates** - When you click, the UI updates instantly (no lag)
2. **Database Sync** - The change is saved to Supabase
3. **Real-time Broadcast** - Supabase broadcasts the change to all connected devices
4. **Other Devices Update** - All other tablets see the change within ~6ms

## Next Steps

- Add cook name input (currently shows "Cook" for all actions)
- Add production day planning view
- Add auto-generated shopping lists
- Add shift handoff notes

## Questions?

Check the browser console (F12) for detailed logs of what's happening. You'll see:
- `‚úÖ Supabase connected!` when connection succeeds
- `üëÇ Listening for real-time updates...` when subscribed
- `üîî Ingredient update:` when changes come in from other devices
